The DAT file is used for storing the sprites. It has the same header as IXF, but seems to be completely different.

==========
Header
==========

The header is simply a 32-bit identifier.

{
	int32 identity; // always 0xD781C380
} header;

==========
Index
==========

The index is a constant 2337 long list of 20-byte entries. This seems to be an expanded version
of the IXF files to fit more data.

The boats file is named 15, which equates to 21 in decimal. This is the value of the first int32
in the index. So I am very sure it is some sort of IXF ID.

The size is always 20.

{
	int unknown; // no idea, always the same per entry per file (perhaps a directory?)
	int id; // id, counts sequentially
	int type; // fairly sure this is the type
	int offset; // the offset in the file
	int length; // length
} entry;

The first offset should always be 20484.
