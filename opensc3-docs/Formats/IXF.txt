The IXF file is used for the majority of the data, my guesses show that it's a directory 
with 32-bit indexes. It's extension is usually IXF.


==========
Header
==========

The header is simply a 32-bit identifier.

{
	int32 identity; // always 0xD781C380
} header;

==========
Index
==========

The index is a constant 1024 long list of 20-byte entries. I'm working of the idea that unknown is a "directory"
and the id is the "file". Perhaps a CRC32 of the name?

{
	int directory; // think this is the id of the ixf, like a directory name
	int id; // id, counts sequentially
	int type; // fairly sure this is the type
	int offset; // the offset in the file
	int length; // length
} entry;

The first offset should always be 20484.

==========
Data
==========

The file data is located at each offset provided by the entry, and then the size of the
length. Not too difficult.
