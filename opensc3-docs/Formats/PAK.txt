The PAK file is used for storing only the game rules as far as I can tell. It has no directories, featuring a single
index of filenames. The files themselves are series of strings, seperated by new lines.

PAK files only store this special key value data, which is why a length is not required.

A note on strings however. They are prefixed with a 32-bit length indicator, like so:

{
	int32 length;
	char chars[length];
} pak_string;

==========
Header
==========

The header contains the number of variable byte file indexes.

{
	int32 entries; // number of entires
} header;


==========
Index
==========

The index is a list of entry structures to the amount specified in the header. Nothing too complicated.
Since a pak_string is variable, there is no pre-determined size, but they are always at least 8 bytes.

{
	pak_string name; // name of the file
	int32 offset; // offset in file
} entry;

==========
Entry
==========

An entry is an array of strings, as far as I know - this is used for the INI files. Each section
and combined key-value is seperated into a pak_string. For example:

pak_string = "[Admin]"
pak_string = "Enabled=true; hello"

{
	int32 values; // number of values
} entry_header;

From here, it's just an array of pak_string's for the amount of values specified for the entry.
